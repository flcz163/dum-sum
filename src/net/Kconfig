	  Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y here.
	  The reason is that some programs need kernel networking support even
	  when running on a stand-alone machine that isn't connected to any
	  other computer.
	  
	  If you are upgrading from an older kernel, you
	  should consider updating your networking tools too because changes
	  in the kernel and the tools often go hand in hand. The tools are
	  contained in the package net-tools, the location and version number
	  of which are given in <file:Documentation/Changes>.

	  For a general introduction to Linux networking, it is highly
	  recommended to read the NET-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.
